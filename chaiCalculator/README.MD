#MAKING CHAI BORA(ml)

*INTRODUCTION.
This is a javascript calculator that I created to help a user determine the portions of each ingredient they need to use to accurately make a cup of Kenyan Chai.

*RECIPE PER CUP
Water:200ml
Milk:50 ml
Tea leaves(Majani):1 tablespoon
Sugar(sukari):2 teaspoons

*HOW IT WORKS
It asks the user how many cups of chai they want to make and then calculates how much of each ingredient is needed based on the input using prompt().The output is then printed in the browser console.
